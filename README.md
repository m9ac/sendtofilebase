This is a lambda function for replicating AWS S3 bucket uploads to an over-vender S3 compatible storage solution

The 3rd-party vender in this example is called Filebase

There are others, but as long as the other vender claims S3 compatibility, this lambda function should not need to change much. As will all things, check the documentation with the vender of your choice for specific configurations

Enjoy and happy networking
